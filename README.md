When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called **nodes**, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

The worker node(s) host the **Pods** that are the components of the application workload. The **control plane** manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.

This document outlines the various components you need to have for a complete and working Kubernetes cluster.
